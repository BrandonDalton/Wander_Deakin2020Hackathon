## What is Wander?

Wander is a productivity app that we created for the Deakin in Isolation Hackathon in 2020, the idea is to allow users to track their productivity daily through the use of goals and do lists. The unique feature that sets it apart from every other productive app is the break suggestion, which gives users after their productivity timer is complete a set of breaks which they can use. Mediation , Yoga and Walking to Locations through the use of the Google API is what sets this app apart.
